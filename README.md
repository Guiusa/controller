I use this stupid stuff as a toolbar on my laptop

# Q&A
1. Why do you need specifically brightness, volume and shutdown functional buttons
on your laptop?



2. Why don't you just install some ready-to-go toolbar from pacamn repositories or
even from AUR ?

3. Why there is hardcoded bash commands on your backend ?

Because it is built for my specific setup. It will change soon. Also it is as 
open source as it gets so just reimplement it.
4. This code is trash aren't you ashamed

Not really I trew maybe 50% of the functionalities of this program on chatGPT so
probably it's their shitty code. Also I'm not a webdev in fact I really hate 
webdev and I think web pages are all satanic constructs.

5. Well why did you implemented it as an web page then ?

Cause I have a really crazy ideia I'll implement soon enough and that will need
an web page to work.
